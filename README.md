# NUMPY

## Introduction

NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

NumPy is a library that helps us handle large and multidimensional arrays and matrices. It provides a large collection of powerful methods to do multiple operations.

NumPy Arrays NumPy arrays are n-dimensional arrays containing data of the same type in the form of rows and columns. We can create these arrays in the following way:

## Installation
