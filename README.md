# NUMPY

## Introduction

NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

NumPy is a library that helps us handle large and multidimensional arrays and matrices. It provides a large collection of powerful methods to do multiple operations.

NumPy Arrays NumPy arrays are n-dimensional arrays containing data of the same type in the form of rows and columns. We can create these arrays in the following way:

## Installation

To install requirement python libraries :

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```


## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

#### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

``` 
jupyter notebook
```
